## Supervised learning 
We know the structure and outcome. We split data into training and test data

* Deals with labeled data

| Supervised learning |                             |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------|
| **Methods**             |classification, regression, svm|
| **Validation methods**  |cross validation                          |
| **Algorithms**          |Decision tree, C4.5, K-NN             |

### Classification
Classify labeled data

K-Nearest Neighbors - > A classification model

Examples of classifications

### Regression
Predicting trends using previous labeled data

To do

- [X] images
- [ ] codes
- [ ] app

### Examples of svm (Support vector machine)
Look at skulls_epoch

## Unsupervised learning
We don't know much about our data, don't know the outcomes

* Deals with unlabeled data
* More complex algorithms than supervised learning
* Fewer tests than supervised

| **Methods**           |clustering |

### Clustering
Finding patterns and groups in unlabeled data
